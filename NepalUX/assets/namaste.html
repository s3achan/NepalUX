<h2>Welcome to Nepal</h2>
<p align="justify">Namaste and Welcome to Nepal! The Himalayan country conjures up the images of snow-capped mountains and rolling green hills. Indeed, out of ten tallest mountains of the world, eight stand in Nepal, making Nepal a mountaineer’s dream.</p>

<p align="justify">Nepal , a small country with an area of approximately 147181 sq kms is diverse geographically as well as ethnically with more than 61 ethnic groups and 70 spoken languages. You will find rich cultures and vibrant traditions, exquisite temples and monuments as well as fast flowing rivers and tropical jungles teeming with wildlife, making your trip an unforgettable experience. It is a multicultural, ethnic and multi-lingual country. All the people from different races and religions live in harmony and there is an ideal blending of Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>

<p align="justify">But Nepal has much more to offer than just the high breathtaking Himalayas. Matching the steps with the world at large, Nepal has made a great leap in attaining the world class milestones in every facet of societal life—be it political, economic, education, information-technology or social welfare.</p>

<p align="justify">Nepal is now a secular Federal Democratic Republic abandoning legacy of being the only Hindu Kingdom in the world. The Constituent Assembly election held on 10 April, 2008 marked the beginning of the new era for Nepal.  The democratically elected new government is well poised to bring new and prosperous Nepal eliminating all kinds of social injustice and inequality.</p>
